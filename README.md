## Media Library

Media Library is a [Golang](http://golang.org/) library that support upload files/images to filesystem or cloud storages, with croping, resizing features for images.

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/qor/media_library?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/qor/media_library)

## Usage

Media library could only be used for [GORM-backend](https://github.com/jinzhu/gorm) models as it is using GORM's callbacks to handle file processing, so you need to register callbacks first:

```go
import "github.com/jinzhu/gorm"
import "github.com/qor/media_library"

DB, err = gorm.Open("sqlite3", "demo_db") // [gorm](https://github.com/jinzhu/gorm)

media_library.RegisterCallbacks(&DB)
```

Add supports to structs

```go
// upload file to FileSystem
import "github.com/qor/media_library"

type Product struct {
	gorm.Model
	Image media_library.FileSystem
}

// Upload file to s3
import "github.com/qor/media_library/aws"

type Product struct {
	gorm.Model
	Image aws.S3
}
```

And you're done! you could use it like this:

```go
var product Product

if productImage, err := os.Open("product_image.png"); err == nil {
	product.Image.Scan(productImage)
}

DB.Save(&product)

// Get image's url, will be s3 url if it is uploaded to s3
product.Image.URL()
```

## Advanced Usage

```go
// Resize images into different sizes when saving images
type ProductIconImageStorage struct{
	media_library.FileSystem
}

func (ProductIconImageStorage) GetSizes() map[string]media_library.Size {
	return map[string]media_library.Size{
		"small":    {Width: 60 * 2, Height: 60 * 2},
		"small@ld": {Width: 60, Height: 60},

		"middle":    {Width: 108 * 2, Height: 108 * 2},
		"middle@ld": {Width: 108, Height: 108},

		"big":    {Width: 144 * 2, Height: 144 * 2},
		"big@ld": {Width: 144, Height: 144},
	}
}
```

## [Qor Support](https://github.com/qor/qor)

[QOR](http://getqor.com) is architected from the ground up to accelerate development and deployment of Content Management Systems, E-commerce Systems, and Business Applications, and comprised of modules that abstract common features for such system.

Media library could be used alone, and it works nicely with QOR, if you have requirements to manage your application's data, be sure to check QOR out!
